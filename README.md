# hello-world
first GitHub project
Well.... I finally did it. I took the plunge and decided to really find out once and for all what this GitHub thing is really all about. The truth is I woke up one day and realized that the tech world had left me in the dust I am clueless, and it is no longer 2001. Whereas  I was once relatively savvy compared to the average person, today I am in danger of becoming just like a hypothetical elderly relative who thinks that your email lives inside your computer.  Time to get to work.
